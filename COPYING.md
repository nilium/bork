Licensing
================================================================================

bork is licensed under one of the two following licenses. You may choose
which of these licenses you wish to use it under. For further options, you may
contact me to discuss your options, but I believe both of these licenses are the
best-suited and would consider any decision to request another license
ill-advised.


MIT License
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you may choose to license bork under the MIT license as follows:

    FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS
    IN THE SOFTWARE.


Do What The Fuck You Want To
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second, you may alternatively choose to license bork under the WTFPL as follows:

    Copyright (C) 2012 Noel Cower <ncower@gmail.com>

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

(Note: this is an abridged WTFPL and not the original WTFPL.)
