* Implement bork-update. Checks for changes to files, updates their position
  in the index if necessary.

* Implement bork-clear. Removes any grabbed files.

* Implement bork-find. Locates all files based on a tag query. Query should use
  simple set operations (unions, intersections, etc.). No primes.

* Implement bork-rm. Removes tags. Files without tags are removed from the
  bork station. bork-update should handle the removal (called after X number
  of operations, maybe?  Possibly treat it like an extremely naive git-gc).
